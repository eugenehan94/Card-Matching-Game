                <h1>Card Matching Game</h1>
                <p>Two players would take turns selecting two cards on the game board. When no cards
                    are left, the player with the most points wins. </p>
                <p>Players who select matching cards would select again until they find a mismatch.</p>    
                <p>If a player clicks on the same card twice, they would lose their turn.</p>
